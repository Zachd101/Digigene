	<h4>What is Digigene?</h4>

	<p>Digigene was founded in 2017 by Max Noteboom and Zachary Dawood. This revolutionary website swept away all competition in the cutthroat world of genetic matching services. It's intuitive design and unique style wowed users from Transnistria to Vanuatu and gave trillions of people a chance at a new relationship. Digigene is a Social Media/Relationship Matching Website that uses the shared suffering that comes with enduring horrible chronic genetic diseases to bring people together.</p>

	<h4>What Did We use to make Digigene?</h4>

	<p>Digigene was coded using html, css and php. In terms of CSS frameworks, We here at Digigene Corp. are proud to say that the amount of outside css frameworks we used was ZERO. THATS RIGHT ZERO BOYS. NO MATERIALIZE NO BOOTSTRAP. JUST HARD WORK, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS. All of our Css here at Digigene Corp is homegrown, freerange and produced in-house. We used Github for version control and used sublime text for editing and debugging. Digigene was coded in Php, html, css and javascript.</p> 


	<h4> 
	Meet the Team: 
	</h4>

	<p>Eustorgius Theodosius Origenes: Our Leader and the creative mind behind Digigene. He first concieved of Digigene in the year 190, just as the Chuping Era of the Han Dynasty was starting. He communicates with his present-day co-workers though a time portal. Even back in the late 100s he was thinking of a way where users could bond through the shared suffering of a genetic disease. He persevered, journeying to the peaks of the Himalayas, in Nepal, to gather the 10 dragon stones. With the dragon stones he travelled to the banks of the nile to place them into the river. When he did, a portal opened up in the water, finally allowing him to share his ideas with the modern world. </p>

	<br>

	<p>Zachary Dawood: Basically the best back-end programmer ever. Wrote this entire website in the time it takes you to write hello world. </p>

	<br> 

	<p>Max Noteboom: Our front end developer here at Digigene. He's dutch. Yeah, that's pretty much it.  We won't pay him until his work becomes satisfactory.  ###Scheduled for firing, delete bio soon###</p>
